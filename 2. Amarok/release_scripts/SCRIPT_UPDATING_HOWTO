Script Updating HOWTO
===============================================================================

This document describes how to release an update for a script that will be 
deployed using Amarok's automatic script updating mechanism. 


A. Quick step-by-step overview:

* Have a look at the code you're about to deploy, to make sure it isn't 
    malicious ;-)
* Check to make sure the version number in script.spec has been incremented
* Create the archive "main.tar.bz2" and the "version" file (see B.3 for 
    details)
* Create the signature (see B.4 above for details)
* Put these three files into amarok.kde.org/scriptupdates/<script-name>/ (see 
    B.2 for details)


B. Appendix: General specification:

1. The base URL for the update repository is amarok.kde.org/scriptupdates/.

2. Inside this directory, for each script there must be a subdirectory that is 
    spelled exactly like the script's directory when Amarok has been installed 
    (i.e. currently "librivox_service", "lyrics_lyricwiki", 
    "radio_station_service" and so on).

3. Inside a script's subdirectory, three files are provided (in case there is 
    an update for this script):
    - "main.tar.bz2": the contents of the update, i.e. the full contents of the 
        script's directory (without the directory itself). Specifically, the 
        files "main.js" and "script.spec" (as well as any additional resources) 
        are directly inside the archive's root. 
    - "version": a plain text file specifying the version of the updated script. 
        Any combination of numbers and dots is supported as the version number. 
        The content of this file is compared by Amarok to the value of 
        X-KDE-PluginInfo-Version in the *installed* script's script.spec in 
        order to determine whether an update is available. 
    - "signature": the digital signature for both the main archive and the 
        "version" file. If this signature is missing or invalid, no update will 
        be performed. 

4. In the utilities/updatesigner/ directory of the Amarok sources, there is a 
    tool for creating signatures (and key pairs), which is per default installed 
    to /usr/bin/amarok-update-signer. To create a signature, cd to the directory 
    where you put "main.tar.bz2" and "version", and run:
    $ amarok-update-signer sign /path/to/your/privkey.pem
    (or run amarok-update-signer without any parameters to get a usage 
    description). This will, after asking you for the key's passphrase,  create 
    the "signature" file.
