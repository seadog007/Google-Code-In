The files in this directory are used for importers' acceptance tests.
These are database files created by different media players, describing
music files found in ./testcollection directory.
Because the database files all describe the same set of tracks,
associated importers can be tested by the same set of generic tests
(contained in ../TestImporterBase.cpp).

Music files contained in ./testcollection/ are only stored to ease
creation of database files for any future importing targets, or
modification of current database files in case of schema changes, etc.
These files are tiny (< the block size) mp3 tracks containing various
id3v2 tags.

When creating a new database file, in addition to importing files
from ./testcollection/ , please follow the directions outlined in
../TestImporterBase.h
